## Introduction
Welcome to our Mechanical Fatigue Prediction Project, where we explore machine learning models for predicting mechanical fatigue in various materials, contributing to safety and reliability in engineering applications.

## Project Overview
Our project focuses on enhancing fatigue life prediction accuracy using machine learning techniques. Accurate fatigue prediction is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of mechanical systems, reducing downtime, maintenance costs, and potential failures.

## Data
The project utilizes a curated dataset encompassing critical features relevant to mechanical fatigue behavior. The data preprocessing phase handled outliers, missing values, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.

## Methods
### Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
GBM techniques, such as XgBoost and LightGBM, excel in capturing intricate patterns in fatigue data. Their ensemble-based learning enhances predictive accuracy.

### AdaBoost
AdaBoost, known for its adaptive boosting, provides improved predictive performance by sequentially training weak models to focus on previously misclassified samples.

### CatBoost
CatBoost, designed to handle categorical data efficiently, is well-suited for datasets with mixed feature types. Its robustness and accuracy make it a valuable choice for fatigue life prediction.

## Results
Our analysis reveals the performance metrics of each model:

- R-squared scores indicating the goodness of fit.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values measuring prediction accuracy.
- Comparative analysis of model strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting fatigue life across different materials. Models such as CatBoost showcase superior performance in specific scenarios, while ensemble methods like GBM techniques offer robustness and accuracy across a wider range of applications.
